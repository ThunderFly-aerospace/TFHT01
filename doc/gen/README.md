Solder paste stats:

Using a paste with 87.75 % alloy, that has an specific gravity for the alloy of 7.4 g/cm³
and 1.0 g/cm³ for the flux. This paste has an specific gravity of  4.15 g/cm³.

The stencil thickness is  0.12 mm.

| Side   | Pads with paste | Area [mm²] | Paste [g] |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Top    |               6 |       9.28 |      0.05 |
| Bottom |              47 |      40.69 |      0.20 |
| Total  |              53 |      49.97 |      0.25 |

Note: this is just an approximation to the theoretical value. Margins of the solder mask and waste aren't computed.
