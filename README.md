# TFHT01 - UAV Humidity and Temperature Sensor

[![Kicad](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFHT01/actions/workflows/kicad_outputs.yml/badge.svg?branch=TFHT01B)](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFHT01/actions/workflows/kicad_outputs.yml)

The TFHT01 hygrometer sensor offers flexible integration options. It can be directly connected to a Pixhawk autopilot with PX4 firmware, or it can be used as a sensor for the [TF-ATMON monitoring system](https://www.thunderfly.cz/tf-atmon.html).

Sensors mounted on UAVs can be used for a variety of purposes. Basically, TFHT01 can measure air temperature and humidity, which can be used for meteorological purposes to estimate whether icing may form on aerodynamic surfaces. It could also be used to determine if the flight is conducted within the operating range of the drone. Another use can be to measure the temperature of selected UAV components, for example, the temperature of batteries, ESC, motor, or some bearings.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Sensing element | [SHT35](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/213E6A3B/63A5A569/Datasheet_SHT3x_DIS.pdf) | Other possible sensors SHT30, SHT31 |
| Typical accuracy | 1.5 %RH and 0.1 °C | |
| Repeatability | 0.15 %RH , 0.08 °C | The stated repeatability is 3 times the standard deviation (3σ) of multiple consecutive measurements at constant ambient conditions. |
| Operating temperature range| 0 °C - +65 °C | Sensor physically measures in range -40°C to +120°C with reduced accuracy |
| Operating humidity range| 0-100 % | At humidity above 80% the performance of the sensor could be degraded in case of prolonged time periods |
| I2C connector | 4-pin JST-GH | The second connector could be installed on the opposite side |
| I2C address | 0x44 default | By switching of JP1 is possible change address to 0x45 |
| Storage temperature range| -20 °C - +40 °C |  |
| Operational input voltage | 3.6 - 5.4V | Overvoltage internally protected by zener diode |
| Mass | 2 g | PCB without cabling |
| Dimensions | 30 x 15 x 6.5 mm |  PCB |
| Weather resistance | IP40 | External connectors fully occupied. The sensor itself could be protected by IP67 according the [sensirion datasheet](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/9D103E42/61641F0F/Sensirion_Humidity_Sensors_SHT3x_Datasheet_Filter_Membrane.pdf) |


## Applications

### Atmospheric sounding

The TFHT01 sensor could be used for [direct atmospheric sounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_sounding). Here is an example of measured data taken by [TF-G2 autogyro](https://www.thunderfly.cz/tf-g2.html).

## Schematics

[![Schematics](/doc/gen/TFHT01B-schematic.svg)](/doc/gen/TFHT01B-schematic.pdf)

## Usage in PX4 
The sensor is currently supported by the PX4 autopilot. Multiple sensors can be connected to one autopilot. The measured data are immediately sent to the ground station and they are also logged in the onboard ulog file. Sensor support can be enabled by setting the [SENS_EN_SHT3X](http://docs.px4.io/master/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#SENS_EN_SHT3X) parameter to 1.
