# TFHT01 ThunderFly Humidity and Temperature sensor

Sensor could be directly connected to Pixhawk autopilot with PX4 firmware, or could be used as a sensor of [TF-ATMON monitoring system](https://www.thunderfly.cz/tf-atmon.html). 

Sensor mounted on UAV can be used for a variety of use. It can be used to measure atmospheric temperature and humidity, which can be used to estimate whether icing may form on aerodynamic surfaces. Or to determinate if the flight is conducted within the operating range of the drone.Another use can be to measure the temperature of selected UAV components. For example temperature of batteries, ESC, motor or some bearings.

| I2C connector | 4-pin JST-GH | The second connector could be installed on opposite side |
| I2C adress | 0x44 default | By switching of JP1 is possible change to 0x45 |
| Operating and storage temperature | -20 - +40Â°C |  |
| Operational humidity | 0-100 % | At humidity above 80% the performance of the sensor could be degraded in case of prolonged time periods |
| Operational input voltage | 3.6 - 5.4V | Overvoltage internally protected by zener diode |
| Mass | 2 g | PCB without cabling |
| Dimensions | 30 x 15 x 6.5 mm |  PCB |
| Weather resistance | IP40 | External connectors fully occupied. The sensor itself is protected by IP67 according the [sensirion datasheet](https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/2_Humidity_Sensors/Datasheets/Sensirion_Humidity_Sensors_SHT3x_Datasheet_Filter_Membrane.pdf) |

## PX4 
The sensor is currently supported by the PX4 autopilot. Multiple sensors can be connected to one autopilot. The measured data are immediately sent to the ground station and they are also logged in the onboard ulog file. Sensor support can be enabled by setting the [SENS_EN_SHT3X](http://docs.px4.io/master/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#SENS_EN_SHT3X) parameter to 1. 

## Availability
The device can be purchased from [ThunderFly s.r.o.](https://www.thunderfly.cz/). Contact us by email info@thunderfly.cz for a commercial quotation.
